# Darwin
My first project using genetic algorithm.

Programm mutates and splits given character sequences. Each sequence gets tested by a selected function (eg. the more '4' it has the better) and if it scores low enough it gets removed. After a specified amount of generations, all of the generated sequences are printed and saved in a specified output file.
